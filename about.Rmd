Welcome to **Computational Biology for All**!  I'm Nathan Brouwer, a biology lecturer at the University of [Pittsburgh Department of Biological Science](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/).  I've been using for over a decade to do and teach statistical modeling, populations simulations, bioinformatics and phylogenetics.
