Welcome to **Computational Biology for All**!  I'm Nathan Brouwer, a data scientist and biology lecturer at the University of [Pittsburgh Department of Biological Science](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/).  I've been using R for over a decade to do and teach statistical modeling, population simulations, bioinformatics and phylogenetics.
