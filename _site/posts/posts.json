I’ll use base R and lattice graphics in this post to demonstrate how to do this and perhaps try ggplot2 in the future.\nThe example shown above is from a paper on African elephants by Foley and Faust 2010 called “Rapid population growth in an elephant Loxodonta africana population recovering from poaching in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania”, in the animal conservation journal Oryx.\nThe left axis shows the estimated number of conceptions in the population (determined by back-calculating from date of birth) and the right axis shows rainfall. It appears that elephant conception (and subsequent birth) is timed with the rains.\nI extracted the data from Figure 4 of Foley and Faust (2010) using metaDigitise.\nThe dataset is small and reproduced below:\n\n\nmonth.i   <- c( 1,  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11, 12)\nmonth.num <- c(11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19)\nmonth.name <- c(\"Nov\",  \"Dec\", \"Jan\", \"Feb\",\n                 \"Mar\",  \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\",\n                 \"July\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\")\nconceptions <- c(10, 42,34,18, 30, 55,68, 48,24,23,11,8)\nrainfall    <- c(60,100,95,78,130,160,58,  4, 3, 3, 2,18)\n\n\nEasy plot choice: side by side\nThe easiest way to display the data is in two side-by-side figures. I’ll use the function mtext() for the axes labels instead of the default locations.\n\n\n# set par() for side by side plots \n## and mar() for narrow margins\npar(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(4,4,1,2))\n\n# left-hand plot\n## the plot\nplot(conceptions ~ month.i, type = \"b\", xlab = \"\", \n     ylab = \"\", xaxt=\"n\", pch = 16, cex = 1.25)\n\n## margin-text\nmtext(text = \"Month\", side = 1, line = 2.25, cex = 1.2)\nmtext(text = \"Conceptions\", side = 2, line = 2, cex = 1.2)\naxis(side = 1, at=1:12, labels=month.name)\n\n# right-hand plot\nplot(rainfall ~ month.i, type = \"b\", xlab = \"\", ylab = \"\", \n     xaxt=\"n\", pch = 18, cex = 1.25)\nmtext(text = \"Month\", side = 1, line = 2, cex = 1.2)\nmtext(text = \"Rainfall\", side = 2, line = 2.25, cex = 1.2)\naxis(side = 1, at=1:12, labels=month.name)\n\n\n\nA dual axis graph\nA dual-axis plot can be made using [lattice graphics[(https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html). The code below was adapted from The R Graph Gallery: Dual Y axis in R, which was a dual-axis example with just line graphs.\nA dual axis plot with lattic requires making make two separate plots:\nA barplot using lattice::barplot()\nA line plot using lattice::xyplot\nThe two plots then get overlaid.\nFirst, I need lattice and latticeExtra.\n\n\nlibrary(lattice)\nlibrary(latticeExtra)\n\n\nI’ll bundle the data into a dataframe for convenience:\n\n\ndf <- data.frame(month.i, \n                 month.name, \n                 conceptions, \n                 rainfall)\n\n\nNow first, a barplot for the conceptions, stored in an object:\n\n\nconceptions <- barchart(conceptions ~ month.i, \n                 data = df, \n                 type = \"l\" , \n                 horizontal = F,\n                 lwd=2, col=\"darkgrey\", \n                 ylab = \"Conceptions (grey bars)\", \n                 xlab = \"Month\", \n                 main = \"Elephant conceptions vs. rainfall, Tarangire NP Tanzania\")\n\n\nThis looks nice enough when I call up the object holding the plot:\n\n\nconceptions\n\n\n\nNow the rainfall data using xyplot.\n\n\nrainfall <- xyplot(rainfall ~ month.i, \n                   data = df, type = \"b\", lwd=3, \n                   cex = 2, pch = 18, \n                   ylab = \"Rainfall (mm; blue triangles)\",\n                   xlab = \"Conceptions\")\n\n\nThe plots are overlaid with dual axes using latticeExtra::doubleYScale\n\n\ndoubleYScale(conceptions,  # the bar graph\n             rainfall,     # the line graph\n             add.ylab2 = TRUE,\n             use.style = FALSE, \n             xlab = \"\")\n\n\n\nThere are drawback to dual-axis plots, but this does show the correlation between the demographic process of conception and the environmental process of rainfall. Further explorations could be done using lagged correlations. Due to the actual duration of gestation in elephants (22 months) there is hypothesized to be a lag between the two variables so that birth coincides with better rainfall and therefore environmental and foraging conditions.\nReferences\nFoley and Faust 2010.
