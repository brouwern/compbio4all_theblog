Welcome to **Computational Biology for All**.  This blog is dedicated to introducing and explaining quantitative methods to biologists.  Topics will include:

* computational biology
* bioinformatics
* phylogenetics
* data science
* statistical analysis
* simulation
* data visualization


To kick off the blog I am going to do a series outlining how to carryout a common task in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and evolutionary biology: building a [multiple sequence alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) and [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) using protein sequences obtained from the National Institutes of Health's databases.
