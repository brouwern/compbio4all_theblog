The data are on the abundance of elephants in a national park in Tanzania where poaching has dropped dramatically, and taken from [Foley and Faust (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/rapid-population-growth-in-an-elephant-loxodonta-africana-population-recovering-from-poaching-in-tarangire-national-park-tanzania/2DADFFCB562E9553B1DF7688EB372FBF), [Table 1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/rapid-population-growth-in-an-elephant-loxodonta-africana-population-recovering-from-poaching-in-tarangire-national-park-tanzania/2DADFFCB562E9553B1DF7688EB372FBF).


To plot the data in base R I need only 

1. Three lines of code
1. One plotting function, plot() 
1. One arguement, type = "b"

```{r}
Year      <- c(1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005)
Elephants <- c(226,232,292,311,313,345,406,411,440,494,485,498)
plot(Elephants ~ Year, type = "b")
```

The syntax I've used is the same y = mx+b format folks learn in high school, and moreover is the same as that used for regression in R using the lm() function.


To plot the data in ggplot2 I need 

1. 7 lines of code 
1. 6 functions, including
    + data.frame() to turn my data into a dataframe
    + library() to call up
    + aes() to set up the x vs. y relationship
    + 2 function to actually make the plot, geom_line() AND geom_point()

```{r}
Year      <- c(1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005)
Elephants <- c(226,232,292,311,313,345,406,411,440,494,485,498)
dat <- data.frame(Year, Elephants)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(y = Elephants, x = Year), data = dat) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()


```

Moreover, the syntax doesn't elicit the geometry of the relationship. Also, in this particular case ggplot is setting the increments of the x axis to non-sensical values of 1997.5 and 2002.5.


```{r}
ggplot(aes(y = Elephants, x = Year), data = dat) +
  geom_line(size = 2, color = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = 3)

```



```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
i.last <- length(Elephants)
delta.N <- Elephants[-1]-Elephants[-i.last]
```
